P.S.: I am aware that only git push is visible in the git commands screeshot. I completed all the previous clone, branch, and add commands, but somehow by the time I was done pushing the commit, only the git push command was left in the git terminal (the text before the git push command are from an unrelated project done before the first clone command for CSE 110). I'm not sure how this happened (perhaps it's some perk with vim, as a vim window popped up to fill the terminal for me to enter the commit message), but somehow it did. That's why only the git push command is visible.
